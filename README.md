# INFO8665-ProjectML-Moosic
> Moosic will be an app people use when they want music that matches how they feel. It will use AI to read your mood from your face, voice, or words, and then suggest songs that fit your feelings. This will help users feel better and keep them coming back

# Emotion Detection Use Case 


## Emotion Detection Using CNN (Valence & Arousal Regression)

This project captures real-time video frames, detects faces, and predicts emotional valence and arousal using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It supports live camera capture, real-time predictions, saving captured images and scores, and visual display of results.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download** the project.

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This includes:
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tqdm

---

## 🧠 Model Training

To train the model:

```bash
python model_training.py
```

- Loads and preprocesses data from `training.csv`
- Trains two CNN models
- Saves the best performing model as `Emotion_Recognition_Model.h5`
- Plots training history comparison

---

## 🎥 Real-Time Emotion Detection

To start live emotion detection and capture:

```bash
python model_deployment.py
```

### Features:
- Detects face using Haar Cascade
- Predicts valence & arousal for the face
- Press `c` to capture an image + save its prediction
- Press `q` to quit

Saved data:
- Captured images: `captured_data/`
- Scores logged to: `captured_data/emotion_scores.csv`

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Input image size: **96x96 grayscale**
- Valence & Arousal range: **[-1, 1]**
- Ensure webcam is enabled and accessible
- Close `emotion_scores.csv` if appending fails (PermissionError)
